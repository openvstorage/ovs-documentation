# Open vStorage
## What is Open vStorage

Open vStorage is an open-source, scale-out, reliable, high performance, software based storage platform which offers a block & file interface on top of a pool of drives.

Open vStorage is licensed under the [AGPLv3 License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html).

Open vStorage is a GeoScale Store Platform. We fundamentally disrupt the way data is stored by converging virtual machines and container technology directly with their local filesystem and directing storage workloads to virtual block devices. The possibilities are endless.

### GeoFlow
GeoFlow enables you to instantly move your virtual workloads and make them available over different hosts in multiple data centers. GeoFlow allows you to scale your storage capacity independently from any cloud stack and hypervisor. It speeds up the integration of your virtual workflows into different hypervisor and container technologies such as Docker, Hyper-V, VMware or OpenStack.

### GeoSpread
GeoSpread delivers the ultimate storage reliability. Your storage cluster is geographically distributed and spread into multiple storage hosts and data centers. The overall storage overhead decreases up to 50% while individual host outages or even complete data center disasters will never result in data loss. GeoSpread eliminates 3-way data replication and uses algorithms for reliability and availability.

### GeoSpeed
GeoSpeed delivers the ultimate geographical distribution and limitless scalability of your storage platform while maintaining the highest levels of performance. Open vStorage is used as a software-defined framework for 100TB+ storage clusters in a single local area network and 100PB+ globally distributed, multi-location clusters generating at least 200K IOPS per host over wide area networks.

Open vStorage introduces new storage dynamics to make your storage capacity highly reliable using the GeoScale technology framework. This eliminates complexity and overhead such as backups, downtime, disaster recovery, copy, etc.

## The Open vStorage Vision
 The vision behind Open vStorage was to build a storage platform where the user has zero concerns:
* Zero downtime: fail-safe, redundant storage cluster across many datacenters
* Zero touch: ultimate storage reliability through self-healing algorithms
* Zero backup: secure storage with no replication and unlimited snapshots
* Zero copy: full history is stored with instant roll-back and roll-forward
* Zero overhead: storage delivers optimal space efficiency and performance
* Zero technology lock-in: open architecture with lowest TCO in the market
