This section is intended for (End-) Users who want to implement and manage Open vStorage. You can learn what is needed to setup Open vStorage, add your first Storage Backend and create your first vMachine. Once everything is setup you can use the GUI to follow up on how things are running and be amazed of the IOPS Open vStorage is giving you.

time to time. You can find the Open vStorage community
