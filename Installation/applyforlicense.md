### Apply for a free license
**This step is only required in case you installed the Open Storage
Backend packages (openvstorage-hc). Without a license you will not be able to create an Open vStorage Backend. In case you only installed the Open vStorage core
packages you can skip to the [add vPool section](#addvpool).**

Apply for a free community license in the [Administration section](Administration/usingthegui/administration.md).  To apply for a license fill in the
form with your name, company name, email address, telephone number and
indicate that you accept the license agreement. You will receive a license key
by email on the provided email address. Click **Add license** to activate the license. A community license is limited to 4 hosts, 16 ASDs and 49 vDisks. [Contact us](https://www.openvstorage.org/contactus/) in case you need a larger license.
