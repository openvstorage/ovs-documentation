## Install Open vStorage

### Introduction
Open vStorage is developed using a component based approach. By using this approach Open vStorage can be installed flexible and tailored to suit almost any use.
This of course means that setting up Open vStorage isn't as easy as pressing a button as setting up a cluster across multiple datacenters is complex.

Before starting the installation of your Open vStorage cluster, please go through our [Essentials](essentials.md) checklist.

For convenience reasons the Open vStorage team has created a couple of ansible scripts which [deploy Open vStorage with Ansible](https://openvstorage.gitbooks.io/devops/content/Docs/ansible.html).  The ansible scripts are part of the commercial Open vStorage license. [Contact us](http://www.openvstorage.com/contact_us/) for more information.

For administrators there is a step by step guide to install [a GeoScale cluster on KVM/QEMU](geoscale.md).
