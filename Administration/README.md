## Administration

This section of the documentation describes how to use and manage an Open vStorage cluster. An Open vStorage Cluster can be managed through different interfaces:
- [Using the GUI](usingthegui/README.md)
- [Using the API](usingtheapi/README.md)
- [Using the CLI](usingthecli/README.md)


Under [services](Services/README.md) you get an overview of the different services which are running in an Open vStorage cluster.

The team behind Open vStorage regularly releases new versions of the software. The necessary steps to update an environment can be found [here](upgrade.md).
